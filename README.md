### Access Locally

Pulldown a local copy of the Github repository Netlify created for you, with the name you specified in the previous step

```
$ git clone https://github.com/[blocksurance-dao]/[blocksurance].git

## Debugging

Windows users, who aren't using [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), might encounter `node-gyp` errors when trying to npm install.
To resolve, make sure that you have both Python 2.7 and the Visual C++ build environment installed.

```
npm config set python python2.7
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

[Full details here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp "NPM node-gyp page").

MacOS and WSL users who might also encounter some errors, check [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) for more info. We recommend using the latest stable node version.
